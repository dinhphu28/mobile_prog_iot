# Client side for TE Smart

I want to say thanks to Phu (@dinhphu28) for developing the server side of this app!

To run this project, install ionic CLI first:

```sh
    yarn global add @ionic/cli
```

Then clone the repository, go to the TE-smart folder, install all dependences:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nhhao/te-smart-client.git
    cd te-smart-client
    yarn
```

After that, run:

```sh
    ionic serve
```

And enjoy the result. You should resize your browser to a small (like a smartphone) width or turn on Responsive Develope Mode on your browser and then select the phone view
Please report to me if you meet any problem!
